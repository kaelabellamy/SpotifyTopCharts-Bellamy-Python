# dataminingproject

You must “engineer” (create) 5 new data columns/fields that are used in your models. Provide rationale as to the reason that you chose the creation of these columns.
- Column 1: BeginHighWeek
- Column 2: End High Week
- Column 3: # of days it took to get to highest charting position aks DaystoTop
- Column 4: binomial for highest position aka HighestPos
- Column 5: 


# Binomal Regression

Create multiple models using different variables: DaystoTop, HighestPos, and ... 

Decide best model.

For this project select a dataset that includes a binary, nominal class or ordinal class value that you wish to predict (or a continuous value data element that could be used to create a label to predict) and create a set of “classifiers” (prediction models) that predict the categorical output. 

Determine which methodology/model is the “winner” and provide your reasoning (“I like this method because it’s really cool” is a valid answer, but for full credit I’m looking for something that’s more substantive).
